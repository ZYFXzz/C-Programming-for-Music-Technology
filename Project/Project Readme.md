# Project Description
This is a small final project for C programming, built on top of the `recplay.c` template provided by the instructor. It is a console-based program capable of:
- Real-time recording and FFT spectrum display
- Playing pre-recorded audio files with visualization
    
# Libraries

- portaudio
- libsndfile
- ncurses
- fftw3
- all installed with MSY2 distribution 

# Running the Project
The process is straightforward:
- Use `build_test.sh` to **automatically build** the program and test all modes, including both playback and recording in a sequential, automated manner.
- Alternatively, you can use:
  - `build.sh` for a **separate build process**
  - `test.sh` to **run individual tests**
